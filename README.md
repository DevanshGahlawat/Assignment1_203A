# Silicon Crystal Impurity Profiles (CZ & FZ)

This repository contains Python scripts to generate and analyze normalized impurity concentration profiles (C(x)/Cm) in silicon crystals grown using **Czochralski (CZ)** and **Float Zone (FZ)** methods.

## Features
- Generate C(x)/Cm profiles for CZ and FZ growth techniques.
- Parametric analysis with respect to segregation coefficient (k) and ingot length (L).
- Compare impurity distributions between CZ and FZ methods.
- Visualize impurity profiles using Matplotlib.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
